## Description

This repository contains all the code for the Landmarks app. This app was developed as part of the SwiftUI Tutorials.
The reason for working my way through the tutorial series is to get started with modern apps for iOS.
I worked on this right after finishing the iOS App Dev Tutorials.
By finishing this application I was able to improve my Swift and SwiftUI skills.

## Notes
This app/project was only developed for learning purposes. If you want to build this app yourself, I suggest taking a look at the tutorial yourself (see Acknowledgments).
